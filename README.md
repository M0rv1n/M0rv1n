-  Hey there, Iâ€™m @M0rv1n. I'm a human (probably) and I like music and games.
- I like to learn new languages. I can speak in c# now and read Java and Python. I somehow know english too.
- I have worked on several projects, though most of them were just to make my work easier and make me "lazy".
- I love Japanese culture, and I would definitely want to go there if I get the chance to.
- I watch animes in my free time, and I am a fan of Re:Zero, Its a masterpiece.
- I mostly like c# just cuz its kinda easy? I also have a bit experience with front-end web development, though I'm still novice
- I am in process of learning new things. I dont get much free time due to college now a days..
- I am open for collaborative projects.
- I luv cats 

That's it, i guess ?
